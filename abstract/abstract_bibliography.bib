               choice on results remains unclear. Here, we carry out a
               community-driven, multi-laboratory comparison in metaproteomics:
               the critical assessment of metaproteome investigation study
               (CAMPI). Based on well-established workflows, we evaluate the
               effect of sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and
               bioinformatic analysis using two samples: a simplified,
               laboratory-assembled human intestinal model and a human fecal
               sample. We observe that variability at the peptide level is
               predominantly due to sample processing workflows, with a smaller
               contribution of bioinformatic pipelines. These peptide-level
               differences largely disappear at the protein group level. While
               differences are observed for predicted community composition,
               similar functional profiles are obtained across workflows. CAMPI
               demonstrates the robustness of present-day metaproteomics

    abstract = "{Inferring taxonomy in mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics is a complex task. In multi-species or viral samples of unknown taxonomic origin, the presence of proteins and corresponding taxa must be inferred from a list of identified peptides, which is often complicated by protein homology: many proteins do not only share peptides within a taxon but also between taxa. However, the correct taxonomic inference is crucial when identifying different viral strains with high-sequence homology—considering, e.g., the different epidemiological characteristics of the various strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2. Additionally, many viruses mutate frequently, further complicating the correct identification of viral proteomic samples.We present PepGM, a probabilistic graphical model for the taxonomic assignment of virus proteomic samples with strain-level resolution and associated confidence scores. PepGM combines the results of a standard proteomic database search algorithm with belief propagation to calculate the marginal distributions, and thus confidence scores, for potential taxonomic assignments. We demonstrate the performance of PepGM using several publicly available virus proteomic datasets, showing its strain-level resolution performance. In two out of eight cases, the taxonomic assignments were only correct on the species level, which PepGM clearly indicates by lower confidence scores.PepGM is written in Python and embedded into a Snakemake workflow. It is available at https://github.com/BAMeScience/PepGM.}",

The field has made tremendous strides over the last 25 years but currently still faces challenges in sensitivity and throughput for widespread applications in personalized medicine and large vaccine development studies. Cutting-edge technological advancements in sample preparation, liquid chromatography as well as mass spectrometry, and data analysis, however, are currently transforming the field. This perspective showcases how the advent of single-cell proteomics has accelerated this transformation of immunopeptidomics in recent years and will pave the way for even more sensitive and higher-throughput immunopeptidomics analyses.},

We call the data structure opportunistic since its space occupancy is decreased when the input is compressible and this space reduction is achieved at no significant slowdown in the query performance. More precisely, its space occupancy is optimal in an information-content sense because text T[1,u] is stored using O(H/sub k/(T))+o(1) bits per input symbol in the worst case, where H/sub k/(T) is the kth order empirical entropy of T (the bound holds for any fixed k). Given an arbitrary string P[1,p], the opportunistic data structure allows to search for the occurrences of P in T in O(p+occlog/sup /spl epsiv//u) time (for any fixed /spl epsiv/>0). If data are uncompressible we achieve the best space bound currently known (Grossi and Vitter, 2000); on compressible data our solution improves the succinct suffix array of (Grossi and Vitter, 2000) and the classical suffix tree and suffix array data structures either in space or in query time or both. We also study our opportunistic data structure in a dynamic setting and devise a variant achieving effective search and update time bounds. Finally, we show how to plug our opportunistic data structure into the Glimpse tool (Manber and Wu, 1994). The result is an indexing tool which achieves sublinear space and sublinear query time complexity.},

Proteins involved in protein refolding and response to oxidative stress appeared to be highly expressed, which suggests that damage to biomolecules is a key challenge for survival.

    abstract = {Metaproteomics has matured into a powerful tool to assess functional interactions in microbial communities. While many metaproteomic workflows are available, the impact of method choice on results remains unclear. Here, we carry out a community-driven, multi-laboratory comparison in metaproteomics: the critical assessment of metaproteome investigation study ({CAMPI}). Based on well-established workflows, we evaluate the effect of sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and bioinformatic analysis using two samples: a simplified, laboratory-assembled human intestinal model and a human fecal sample. We observe that variability at the peptide level is predominantly due to sample processing workflows, with a smaller contribution of bioinformatic pipelines. These peptide-level differences largely disappear at the protein group level. While differences are observed for predicted community composition, similar functional profiles are obtained across workflows. {CAMPI} demonstrates the robustness of present-day metaproteomics research, serves as a template for multi-laboratory studies in metaproteomics, and provides publicly available data sets for benchmarking future developments.},
