               choice on results remains unclear. Here, we carry out a
               community-driven, multi-laboratory comparison in metaproteomics:
               the critical assessment of metaproteome investigation study
               (CAMPI). Based on well-established workflows, we evaluate the
               effect of sample preparation, mass spectrometry, and
               bioinformatic analysis using two samples: a simplified,
               laboratory-assembled human intestinal model and a human fecal
               sample. We observe that variability at the peptide level is
               predominantly due to sample processing workflows, with a smaller
               contribution of bioinformatic pipelines. These peptide-level
               differences largely disappear at the protein group level. While
               differences are observed for predicted community composition,
               similar functional profiles are obtained across workflows. CAMPI
               demonstrates the robustness of present-day metaproteomics
               research, serves as a template for multi-laboratory studies in
               metaproteomics, and provides publicly available data sets for

    abstract = "{Inferring taxonomy in mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics is a complex task. In multi-species or viral samples of unknown taxonomic origin, the presence of proteins and corresponding taxa must be inferred from a list of identified peptides, which is often complicated by protein homology: many proteins do not only share peptides within a taxon but also between taxa. However, the correct taxonomic inference is crucial when identifying different viral strains with high-sequence homology—considering, e.g., the different epidemiological characteristics of the various strains of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus-2. Additionally, many viruses mutate frequently, further complicating the correct identification of viral proteomic samples.We present PepGM, a probabilistic graphical model for the taxonomic assignment of virus proteomic samples with strain-level resolution and associated confidence scores. PepGM combines the results of a standard proteomic database search algorithm with belief propagation to calculate the marginal distributions, and thus confidence scores, for potential taxonomic assignments. We demonstrate the performance of PepGM using several publicly available virus proteomic datasets, showing its strain-level resolution performance. In two out of eight cases, the taxonomic assignments were only correct on the species level, which PepGM clearly indicates by lower confidence scores.PepGM is written in Python and embedded into a Snakemake workflow. It is available at https://github.com/BAMeScience/PepGM.}",

    ABSTRACT = {Immunopeptidomics, as the analysis of antigen peptides being presented to the immune system via major histocompatibility complexes (MHC), is being seen as an imperative tool for identifying epitopes for vaccine development to treat cancer and viral and bacterial infections as well as parasites. The field has made tremendous strides over the last 25 years but currently still faces challenges in sensitivity and throughput for widespread applications in personalized medicine and large vaccine development studies. Cutting-edge technological advancements in sample preparation, liquid chromatography as well as mass spectrometry, and data analysis, however, are currently transforming the field. This perspective showcases how the advent of single-cell proteomics has accelerated this transformation of immunopeptidomics in recent years and will pave the way for even more sensitive and higher-throughput immunopeptidomics analyses.},
